charts made with draw.io

To start the simulation:

- connect a joypad ( tested with playstation-like usb joystick)

- test it with the jstest-gtk utility for linux

- extract the simulator file (.tar.gz file)

- if not done yet, download the v-rep simulator
- execute the v-rep simulator into the extracted folder ( ./vrep.sh )

- eventually, import the scene file with the drone model file

- compile all cpp files ( g++ -pthread *.cpp -o outputfile ), then execute the program ( ./outputfile )

- start (play button on simulator) the simulation



ENJOY
